Wordpress Plugin for Book Authors and Publishers

An Open Source Project from http://www.Pubble.Me/

Goal Functionality:

* Display "Posts" as numbered pages, within chapters, oldest first so they appear in order when being read as a book
* Create a control panel section in the Wordpress Admin panel
* When readers are logged in it automatically displays the page where they stopped reading
